Ubuntu is a Linux-based operating system
Ubuntu is derived from Debian
Ubuntu uses the same APT packaging system as Debian and shares a huge number of packages and libraries from Debian repositories
'apt-***' commands for managing applications in both Debian and Ubuntu
Debian is favorable for server mode because it provides a stable and secure release and created by Ian Murdock in 1993
Ubuntu is for desktop mode because it continuously updates its packages and releases, making it less safe and stable and created in 2004 by Mark Shuttleworth
Biggest distributions that do not derive from any other distribution are Debian, Arch, Red Hat
The system is developed by a UK based company called Canonical Ltd
All the developments are based on the principles of Open Source software development
The normal Ubuntu interface is based on a software called Unity
Kubuntu is based on a software called KDE Plasma desktop
--- try installing one device drivers (press windows key and search for drivers )
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
Some of the terminal editors in ubuntu
Gedit, Nano, Vim, Gvim, Emacs Editor


General Kow-How
A driver/device driver is a piece of software
That software act as an interface to hardware devices, enabling OS and other computer programs to access hardware functions without needing to know precise details about the hardware being used
All I/O devices required device drivers such as keyboards, mice, CD/DVD drives, controllers, printers, graphics cards and ports
If the driver is included in an operating system, it may be referred to as a kernel-mode device driver
Typically, a driver is a dynamic-link library (DLL) with the .sys file name extension
A driver communicates with the device through the computer bus or communications subsystem to which the hardware connects
When a calling program invokes a routine in the driver, the driver issues commands to the device (drives it)
Once the device sends data back to the driver, the driver may invoke routines in the original calling program
Routine is a sequence of program instructions that performs a specific task, packaged as a unit
In different programming languages, a subroutine may be called a routine, subprogram, function, method, or procedure

Wget is a computer tool created by the GNU Project
wget retrieve content and files from various web servers
wget = World Wide Web + get
Supports downloads via FTP, SFTP, HTTP, and HTTPS
Installing wget in ubuntu, sudo apt-get install wget
download in current location : wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
download in a different location : wget -P ./Desktop/ https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
wget to retrieve whole websites, wget --mirror --convert-links --page-requisites --no-parent -P documents/websites/ https://some-website.com

Debian Linux uses 'dpkg'(default package manager) and APT(Advanced Package Tool) for managing(install, update, remove) packages
APT  
    supports local package installation using 'dpkg'
    supports remote package installation
    supports downloading dependencies while installation

DPKG supports 
    support only local package installation
    does not support remote package installation
    does not support downloading dependencies while installation

Tools to interact with APT and allow you to install, remove and manage packages
    apt-get is one such command-line tool
    apt-cache is one such command-line tool
    apt is one such command-line tool. Most commonly used package management commands are scattered across apt-get and apt-cache. apt consists some of the most widely used features from apt-get and apt-cache leaving aside obscure and seldom used features
    Aptitude is a both GUI and command-line tool

Using apt-get commands
apt-get requires administrative(super-user) privileges, as it deals with core aspects of the system
apt-cache does not require administrative privileges
before commencing any operations with apt-get, we need to ensure that our local copy of the package database has been updated
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get autoremove
sudo apt-get install vlc
sudo apt-get purge vlc
apt-cache showpkg vlc
man apt-get && man apt-cache
