# what operating systems do
    = a computer system can be divided roughly into four components
        - hardware
        - operating system
        - application programs
        - users
    = operating system manages computer hardware, system programs, application programs and users
    = an operating system acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and the computer hardware
    = operating system is the program running at all times on the computer called the kernel
    = 2 other types of programs along with the kernel are
        - system programs (associated with the operating system but are not necessarily part of the kernel)
        - application programs (not associated with the operation of the system)
    = mobile operating systems often includes a middleware (set of software frameworks provides services to application developers)
# computer-system organization
    <img src="images/moderncomputersystem.jpg" alt="" width="20%" height="10%">
    = computer-system components
        - a modern computer system consists of one or more CPUs and a number of device controllers connected through a common bus that provide access to shared memory
        - each device controller is in charge of a specific type of device
        - CPUs and device controllers can execute in parallel competing for memory cycles
        - memory controller synchronizes access to the memory
    = computer-system starting
        - when a computer powered up or reboot the initial program to execute is bootstrap program
        - typically this program is stored with in the computer hardware in ROM - readonly memory or firmware(EEPROM - electronically erasable programmable memory)
        - the bootstrap program must locate the operating system kernel and load into memory
        - the kernel starts providing services to the system and the users, some services are provided by few external programs
        - these external programs are called system programs which is loaded to memory at boot time to become system process or daemons(in unix first daemon is 'init')
    = devices and CPU communication(events)
        - events are occurred through interrupt mechanism from either the hardware or the software
        - hardware may trigger an interrupt at any time by sending a signal to the CPUs usually by way of system bus
        - software may trigger an interrupt at any time by executing a special operation called a system call(monitor call)
        - when a CPU is interrupted, it stops the current operation and transfers to a fixed location
        - that fixed location contains the starting address of service routine for the interrupt
        - on completion, the CPU resumes the interrupted computation
        <img src="images/interrupttimeline.jpg" alt="" width="70%" height="40%">
    = storage structure
        <img src="images/storagehierarchy.jpg" alt="" width="20%" height="10%">
        - all forms of memory provide an array of bytes and every byte has an address
        - main memory mainly implemented in a semiconductor technology called DRAM-dynamic random access memory is called RAM
        - SSD, solid state drive is a non-volatile memory and stores data in a DRAM array during normal operation but also contains a hidden magnetic hard disk and a battery
        - when external power is interrupted the SSD's controller will copy data from RAM to disk so its becomes non-volatile. when the external power is restored controller copies the data back to RAM  
        - another non-volatile form is flash memory which doesn't require power to retain its contents and its a variant of EEPROM-electrically erasable programmable read-only memory 
        - another non-volatile form is NVRAM which is DRAM with battery power
    = i/o structure
        <img src="images/devicecontrolleranddriver.jpg" alt="" width="17%" height="10%">
        - every operating system have a device driver for each device controller
        - device driver is a software program with which the device controller interacts with the operating system
        - device controller is a hardware unit attached to the I/O bus and works like an interface between a device and a device driver
        - device controller maintains some local buffer storage and a set of special purpose registers and it is responsible for moving the data between the peripheral devices and its local buffer storage 
        - each device controller is in charge of a specific type of device
        - SCSI-small computer systems interface controller can attach to seven or more devices 
        - how data movement happens (small amount of data movement)
            . device driver loads instructions to appropriate registers on the device controller
            . device controller examines the contents of these registers to determine what action to take(like read)
            . if its read instruction, device controller starts the transfer of data from the I/O device to its local buffer
            . once the transfer completes, device controller informs the device driver via an interrupt that it has finished the operation
            . device driver then returns control to the operating system and load data to memory
        - how data movement happens (bulk data movement)
            . device controller populate local buffers and transfers bulk of data to and from directly to memory
            . this movement does not involve CPU and its called direct memory access(DMA)
# computer-system architecture
    = execution of instructions
        - Von Neumann architecture was first published by John von Neumann in 1945
        <img src="images/vonneumannarchitecture.jpg" alt="" width="17%" height="10%">
        - it is based on the stored-program computer concept, where instruction data and program data are stored in the same memory
        - interaction with CPU and memory unit is achieved through load and store instructions to specific memory addresses
        - load - from main memory to internal registers within the CPU
        - store - from internal registers to main memory
        - need arises, CPUs explicitly loads instructions from main memory for execution
        - instructions are processed via fetch-execute cycle
        - CPU can load instruction only from main memory(RAM-random access memory)
